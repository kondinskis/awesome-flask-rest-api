# Flask API

[Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is realy super-easy and lightweight web appliations framework. If you are familiar with any other framework, transition to Flaks is matter of hours and even it is really simple to learn for beginers.

In addition for the example I will use [Flask-restfulPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) extension. The extension encourages best practices with minimal setup.
